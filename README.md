# Laravel Presenter Registrar

I would appreciate you taking the time to look at my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/faustbrian) and considering to support me if I'm saving you some time with my work.

## The Problem

A lot of times nowadays we are working with dozens of third-party packages and not all of those offer an easy way of replacing models used by them. This means it can become quite a task to extend or replace those if you would like to use something like a Presenter on these. This package tries to solve this issue by registering presenters like Laravel does with Policies to allow binding any Presenter to any model so you don't need to replace third-party models.

## Installation

### Requirements

Require this package, with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), in the root directory of your project.

``` bash
$ composer require faustbrian/laravel-presenter-registrar
```

## Usage

#### Register presenters via PresenterServiceProvider

```html
<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use BrianFaust\PresenterRegistrar\PresenterRegistrarServiceProvider as ServiceProvider;

class PresenterServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    /**
     * The policy mappings for the application.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $presenters = [
        'App\User' => 'App\Presenters\UserPresenter',
        'ThirdParty\Models\Model' => 'App\Presenters\ThirdPartyPresenter',
    ];
}
```

#### Create the previously registered presenter
```php
<?php

namespace App\Presenters;

use BrianFaust\PresenterRegistrar\Presenter;

class UserPresenter extends Presenter
{
    public function fullName()
    {
        return "{$this->model->firstName} {$this->model->lastName}";
    }
}
```

#### Use presenter from anywhere **(usually inside a view)**

``` php
{{ present($user)->fullName }}
```

## Testing

``` bash
$ phpunit
```
